<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>Hi my name is Hernan , i'm from Venezuela but i'm currently living in Argentina, this is not my fist course of HTML and CSS, i've given up other lessons because of my lack of discipline.

</p>

<p>From now on, i'm going to start to strive in order to get the most out of this course. <br>
  I'm looking forward creating the most exciting and dynamic web pages, I know it will not be an easy path but I absolutely certain that it will be worthy .</p>
<p>I also want to discover the multiple functions and JavaScript features in order to learn much more about the fascinating and complex world of coding.</p>
